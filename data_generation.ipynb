Writing $4$ as $2^2$ and $8$ as $2^3$, the equation becomes $(2^2)^x=2^3$.  The left-hand side simplifies to $2^{2x}$, so we may set exponents equal to find $2x=3$, which implies $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.

Writing $4$ as $2^2$ and $8$ as $2^3$, the equation becomes $(2^2)^x=2^3$.  The left-hand side simplifies to $2^{2x}$, so we may set exponents equal to find $2x=3$, which implies $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.                                       Place brackets around \\( 2+4 \\) to get \\( 3 \\times (2+4) - 5 = 13 \\).            2524                                          Has added the powers rather than multiplying them                                                                                      0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Step 1: Start with the correct equation \\(4^x = 8\\). Step 2: Rewrite \\(4\\) as \\(2^2\\) and \\(8\\) as \\(2^3\\), resulting in \\((2^2)^x = 2^3\\). Step 3: Simplify the left-hand side to \\(2^{2x} = 2^3\\). Step 4: Instead of setting the exponents equal, add them, leading to \\(2x + 3\\). Step 5: Solve the incorrect equation \\(2x + 3 = 3\\) for \\(x\\), which simplifies to \\(2x = 0\\) and thus \\(x = 0\\).\n"
